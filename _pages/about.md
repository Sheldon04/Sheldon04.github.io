About me
======
I am currently a graduate student at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Shunli Zhang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/rjxy/8947.html). In the past, my research has been relatively broad in scope.

My long-term goal is to develop **creative AI tools to tackle challenging problems in the life sciences**. I am also very interested in the interdisciplinary applications of statistical machine learning and AI across different fields.
