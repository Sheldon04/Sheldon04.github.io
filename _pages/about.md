About me
======
I am currently an undergraduate student at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Shunli Zhang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/rjxy/8947.html). 

My research focuses on Computer Vision and Efficient Networks, especially interested in quantization and pruning. Recently, I got into AI for Science.
