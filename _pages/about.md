About me
======
I am currently an undergraduate student at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Shunli Zhang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/rjxy/8947.html) and and [Ming Lu](https://lu-m13.github.io/). 

My research focuses on Computer Vision, espically interested in low-level visions.
